# Cookiecutter BigBoi

A [cookiecutter](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter) combining all the best QA features I can find for developing python packages.

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

1. Install `cookiecutter` with:

    ```shell
    $ pip install cookiecutter
    ```

2. Run `cookiecutter` with:

    ```shell
    $ cookiecutter https://github.com/jakeantmann/cookiecutter-bigboi
    ```

3. Enter the requested information, then win! Remember, package names should only have letters, numbers, and underscores.

4. If you're working under version control, copy the repository into your folder tracked under git, commit the files, and push to your remote.

## ‚ùì Why make the biggest boi?

As a learning project! I'm building a python package + corresponding cookiecutter, with the following goals:

- Learn about the various tools and best practises for python package development
- Familiarise myself with CI
- Learn to use cookiecutter for future templating needs

To achieve these goals, I am adding as many interesting-looking tools as possible to my package, especially QA tools like linters, testers etc. These all get added to this cookiecutter, along with reference files that I might find useful - eg an example test file with various methods of testing that I add as I go.

## üç™ Cookiecutter Acknowledgement

This package was created with [@audreyr](https://github.com/audreyr)'s
[cookiecutter](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter). I've learned a lot and included bits and pieces from the following cookiecutters:

- [cookiecutter-pypackage](https://github.com/audreyfeldroy/cookiecutter-pypackage)
- [cookiecutter-snekpack](https://github.com/audreyfeldroy/cookiecutter-pypackage) (this was a big inspiration - check out the accompanying blog posts etc., lots of useful information)
- [cookiecutter-data-science](https://github.com/drivendata/cookiecutter-data-science)

and others. If you want more inspiration, check out this [list of alternative cookiecutters](https://cookiecutter-pypackage.readthedocs.io/en/latest/readme.html#similar-cookiecutter-templates)
